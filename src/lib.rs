//! # Simple Chunk Allocator
//!
//! A simple `no_std` allocator written in Rust that manages memory in fixed-size chunks/blocks. Useful for basic `no_std`
//! binaries where you want to manage a heap of a few megabytes without complex features such as paging/page table
//! management. Instead, this allocator gets a fixed/static memory region and allocates memory from there. This memory
//! region can be contained inside the executable file that uses this allocator. See examples down below.
//!
//! ⚠ _Other allocators with different properties (for example better memory utilization but less
//! performance) do exist. The README of the repository contains a section that discusses how this allocator
//! relates to other existing allocators on <crates.io>._ ⚠
//!
//! ## TL;DR
//! - ✅ `no_std` allocator with test coverage
//! - ✅ uses static memory as backing storage (no paging/page table manipulations)
//! - ✅ allocation strategy is a combination of next-fit and best-fit
//! - ✅ reasonable fast with low code complexity
//! - ✅ const compatibility (no runtime `init()` required)
//! - ✅ efficient in scenarios where heap is a few dozens megabytes in size
//! - ✅ user-friendly API
//!
//! The inner and low-level `ChunkAllocator` can be used as `#[global_allocator]` with the synchronized wrapper type
//! `GlobalChunkAllocator`. Both can be used with the `allocator_api` feature. The latter enables the usage in several
//! types of the Rust standard library, such as `Vec::new_in` or `BTreeMap::new_in`. This is primarily interesting for
//! testing but may also enable other interesting use-cases.
//!
//! The focus is on `const` compatibility. The allocator and the backing memory can get initialized during compile time
//! and need no runtime `init()` call or similar. This means that if the compiler accepts it then the allocation will
//! also work during runtime. However, you can also create allocator objects during runtime.
//!
//! The inner and low-level `ChunkAllocator` is a chunk allocator or also called fixed-size block allocator. It uses a
//! mixture of the strategies next-fit and a best-fit. It tries to use the smallest gap for an allocation request to
//! prevent fragmentation but this is no guarantee. Each allocation is a trade-off between a low allocation time and
//! preventing fragmentation. The default chunk size is `256 bytes` but this can be changed as compile time const generic.
//! Having a fixed-size block allocator enables an easy bookkeeping algorithm through a bitmap but has as consequence that
//! small allocations, such as `64 byte` will take at least one chunk/block of the chosen block size.
//!
//! This project originates from my [Diplom thesis project](https://github.com/phip1611/diplomarbeit-impl). Since I
//! originally had lots of struggles to create this (my first ever allocator), I outsourced it for better testability and
//! to share my knowledge and findings with others in the hope that someone can learn from it in any way.
//!
//!
//! ## Minimal Code Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![feature(const_mut_refs)]
//! #![feature(allocator_api)]
//!
//! use simple_chunk_allocator::{heap, heap_bitmap, GlobalChunkAllocator, PageAligned};
//!
//! // The macros help to get a correctly sized arrays types.
//! // I page-align them for better caching and to improve the availability of
//! // page-aligned addresses.
//!
//! /// Backing storage for heap (1Mib). (read+write) static memory in final executable.
//! ///
//! /// heap!: first argument is chunk amount, second argument is size of each chunk.
//! ///        If no arguments are provided it falls back to defaults.
//! ///        Example: `heap!(chunks=16, chunksize=256)`.
//! static mut HEAP: PageAligned<[u8; 1048576]> = heap!();
//! /// Backing storage for heap bookkeeping bitmap. (read+write) static memory in final executable.
//! ///
//! /// heap_bitmap!: first argument is amount of chunks.
//! ///               If no argument is provided it falls back to a default.
//! ///               Example: `heap_bitmap!(chunks=16)`.
//! static mut HEAP_BITMAP: PageAligned<[u8; 512]> = heap_bitmap!();
//!
//! // please make sure that the backing memory is at least CHUNK_SIZE aligned; better page-aligned
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static ALLOCATOR: GlobalChunkAllocator =
//!     unsafe { GlobalChunkAllocator::new(HEAP.deref_mut_const(), HEAP_BITMAP.deref_mut_const()) };
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // at this point, the allocator already got used a bit by the Rust runtime that executes
//!     // before main() gets called. This is not the case if a `no_std` binary gets produced.
//!     let old_usage = ALLOCATOR.usage();
//!     let mut vec = Vec::new();
//!     vec.push(1);
//!     vec.push(2);
//!     vec.push(3);
//!     assert!(ALLOCATOR.usage() > old_usage);
//!
//!     // use "allocator_api"-feature. You can use this if "ALLOCATOR" is not registered as
//!     // the global allocator. Otherwise, it is already the default.
//!     let _boxed = Box::new_in([1, 2, 3], ALLOCATOR.allocator_api_glue());
//! }
//! ```
